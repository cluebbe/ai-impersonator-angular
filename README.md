# AI Impersonator — Angular

An Angular application that lets you chat with an AI impersonating any well-known person, powered by the [xAI Grok API](https://x.ai). Built as a learning project covering Angular fundamentals: routing, reactive and template-driven forms, signals, guards, and standalone components.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **AI Chat** | Ask questions and get answers as if from any famous person |
| **Contact Form** | Reactive form with full validation (required, email, min/max length) |
| **Authentication** | Login/logout with role-based access control |
| **Route Guards** | Functional `authGuard` protecting the dashboard and admin pages |
| **Notifications** | Signal-based notification system with auto-dismiss |
| **Dashboard** | Server load overview with a custom traffic light component |

---

## Tech Stack

- **Angular 22** (standalone components, new control flow syntax)
- **Node.js 26**
- **TypeScript 6**
- **xAI Grok API** (`grok-4` model)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+ (LTS) or 24+
- Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd ai-impersonator-angular
npm install
```

### Configure the xAI API Key

Copy the environment template and add your key:

```bash
cp src/environments/environment.example.ts src/environments/environment.ts
```

Then edit `src/environments/environment.ts`:

```ts
export const environment = {
  xaiApiKey: 'your-xai-api-key-here',
};
```

`environment.ts` is listed in `.gitignore` and will never be committed.

### Run

```bash
ng serve
```

Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## Demo Credentials

The user list is loaded from `public/userlist.json` at startup.

| Username | Password | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `verySecret` | admin |
| `user` | `verySecret` | user |
| `guest` | `verySecret` | guest |

- **Dashboard** — accessible to any authenticated user
- **Admin** — accessible to the `admin` role only
- **Guest** — sees an upgrade prompt on the dashboard

## Key Concepts in the Code

### Routing with Guards (`app.routes.ts`)

```ts
{ path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent, canActivate: [authGuard] },
{ path: 'admin', component: AdminComponent, canActivate: [authGuard], data: { role: 'admin' } },
```

### Signal-based Notifications (`notification.service.ts`)

```ts
private notifications = signal<NotificationMessage[]>([]);
notifications$ = this.notifications.asReadonly();
```

### Reactive Form with Validation (`contact.component.ts`)

```ts
contactForm = new FormGroup({
  nameControl:    new FormControl('', Validators.required),
  emailControl:   new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.email]),
  messageControl: new FormControl('', [Validators.required, Validators.minLength(10), Validators.maxLength(200)]),
});
```

### New Angular Control Flow (`dashboard.component.html`)

```html
@for (serverload of serverLoads; track serverload.name) {
  <app-traffic-light [value]="serverload.value" [height]="50"></app-traffic-light>
}
```

## Workshop

A step-by-step workshop with exam-style questions is included in [`workshop.md`](./workshop.md). It guides you through rebuilding this application from scratch, with solutions hidden in collapsible detail blocks.

**Part 1 — Navbar, Home & Contact Form**
1. Bootstrap the app
2. Define routes
3. Create the Header / Navbar
4. Create the Chat (Home) component
5. Set up the REST client service
6. Build the Notification system
7. Build the Contact form

**Part 2 — Login, Auth Guard & Dashboard**

8. Create the AuthService
9. Create the Login component
10. Write a functional Auth Guard
11. Protect routes and add Login/Logout to the navbar
12. Build the Dashboard and Traffic Light component

---

## Build

```bash
ng build
```

Artifacts are written to `dist/`. The production build uses esbuild for fast, optimized output.
